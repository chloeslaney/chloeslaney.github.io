Education
======
* Ph.D in Neural Dynamics, University of Bristol, 2016-2021
* MRes in Mental Health Research: Distinction, University of Nottingham, 2015-2016
* B.S.c in Psychology: First Class Honours, University of Durham, 2012-2015

Postdoctoral Training
======
* University of Bristol (2022 – Present)   
  Senior Research Associate in Genetic Epidemiology
  MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, Immunopsychiatry Programme. 
  Supervisor: Professor Golam Khandaker
  Project: Identify biological pathways impacting cognition at different ages in the     lifespan using population-based cohorts (e.g., Lifelines, UK Biobank) and omics data   (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics).

* University of Bristol (2021 – 2022)
  Research Associate in Genetic Epidemiology
  MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit
  Supervisors: Professors Golam Khandaker and George Davey Smith 
  Project: Testing causality between immune proteins and cognition using ALSPAC data. 

Research Skills
======
•	Coding: R and STATA (postdoctoral experience), Python and JavaScript (PhD)
•	Statistical genetics: GWAS, meta-analysis, GWAS annotation (e.g., FUMA), Mendelian randomization (summary and individual level), genetic correlations, genetic risk scores, adjustments for relatedness (e.g., GRAMMAR method via GREML, KING to identify genetic relatedness), multiple imputation to address missing data.
•	Population-based cohort data: analysing cohort data (Lifelines, UK Biobank, ALSPAC).
•	Public and patient involvement in research: workshops/focus groups within and outside UK. 
•	Clinical human experiments (e.g., ethics applications, interviewing, coding experiments, EEG). 
•	Open science: pre-registrations (osf.io/npeja), preprints, code (chloeslaney (chloeslaney) / Repositories · GitHub) and datasets (https://doi.org/10.5523/bris.1wlrhv4jzqs7q2egf8i7ruzta1).
