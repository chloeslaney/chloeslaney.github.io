I'm Chloe, a genetic epidemiologist at the [MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU)](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/integrative-epidemiology/), University of Bristol. 

Current Research
======
1. Biological Pathways Influencing Cognition
Based in the Immunopsychiatry programme led by Prof. Golam Khandaker, I'm investigating biological pathways which may impact cognitive functioning at different ages in the lifespan using non-genetic and genetic epidemiological methods. To do this, I work with large population-based cohort data from the [UK Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) and the [Lifelines Cohort](https://www.lifelines-biobank.com/0) in the Netherlands. 

2. ALDH2 Consortium
I am working with Prof. George Davey Smith to establish an ALDH2 Consortium, which aims to address several questions related to the ALDH2 rs671 genotype. For more details, please visit the [ALDH2 Consortium Website](https://aldh2-consortium.github.io/).

Past Research
======
Before joining the MRC IEU, I did my PhD on the Wellcome Neural Dynamics Programme at the University of Bristol (supervised by Prof. Emma Robinson, Dr. Conor Houghton, Prof. Ian Penton-Voak, and Prof. Marcus Munafo). During my PhD, I was investigating a core symptom of many mental health conditions -- Anhedonia -- and its relation to how we process rewards (e.g., our motivation to obtain something rewarding, our ability to learn and remember what predicts rewards).
